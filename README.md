### Hi there I'm Steppa AKA The API ArtistðŸ‘‹
 I am a Django developer with a genuine love for the framework and developing APIs the best way they can be developed
I am always learning and willing to learn. I develop APIs that are scalable and robust. Long story short, I'm the Picasso of backend developmentðŸ™ƒðŸ˜‰. With every project better than the last, My level of expertise is nowhere near its peak.... Cheers to better, clean and effecient codesðŸ¥‚
My motto: Stick to the Code
