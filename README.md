### 👋 Introduction

Hi there! I’m Steppa, also known as **The API Artist**. As a Django developer, I’m dedicated to crafting APIs in the most exquisite ways possible. I approach backend development as an art form, earning the nickname "The API Artist" because I treat each project as a canvas, meticulously shaping every detail to create efficient and impactful solutions—true masterpieces.

### 🎨 Expertise and Skills

With **over two years of experience**, my expertise lies in building APIs that are not only highly functional but also robust and scalable.** Python** and **Django** are my core tools, which I use to design structured, maintainable applications that meet real-world demands. My development philosophy is anchored in the principle “Stick to the Code” — a commitment to writing clean, efficient, and refined code, where the true artistry of backend development shines.

### 🚀 Growth Mindset

Driven by a constant pursuit of knowledge, I push the boundaries of what’s possible in API design, viewing each project as an opportunity to refine my skills and make an impact.
